# Eye-Contact-AI
Eye Contact AI is currently a binary classification model for images of faces with eyes looking down (at the computer screen) and looking directly at the camera. Later, it will be able to take in video of a person looking down or to the side and readjust the eyes to point to the camera in real-time so that video meetings have more human connection.
